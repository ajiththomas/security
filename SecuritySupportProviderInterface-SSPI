Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)

Is the API that can be use to authenticate users.

The SSPI will be in charge of finding the adequate protocol for two machines that want to communicate. The preferred method for this is Kerberos. Then the SSPI will negotiate which authentication protocol will be used, these authentication protocols are called Security Support Provider (SSP), are located inside each Windows machine in the form of a DLL and both machines must support the same to be able to communicate.
Main SSPs

    Kerberos: The preferred one
        %windir%\Windows\System32\kerberos.dll
    NTLMv1 and NTLMv2: Compatibility reasons
        %windir%\Windows\System32\msv1_0.dll
    Digest: Web servers and LDAP, password in form of a MD5 hash
        %windir%\Windows\System32\Wdigest.dll
    Schannel: SSL and TLS
        %windir%\Windows\System32\Schannel.dll
    Negotiate: It is used to negotiate the protocol to use (Kerberos or NTLM being Kerberos the default one)
        %windir%\Windows\System32\lsasrv.dll

The negotiation could offer several methods or only one.
