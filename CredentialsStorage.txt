Credentials Storage
Security Accounts Manager (SAM)

Local credentials are present in this file, the passwords are hashed.
Local Security Authority (LSA) - LSASS

The credentials (hashed) are saved in the memory of this subsystem for Single Sign-On reasons.
LSA administrates the local security policy (password policy, users permissions...), authentication, access tokens...
LSA will be the one that will check for provided credentials inside the SAM file (for a local login) and talk with the domain controller to authenticate a domain user.

The credentials are saved inside the process LSASS: Kerberos tickets, hashes NT and LM, easily decrypted passwords.
LSA secrets

LSA could save in disk some credentials:

    Password of the computer account of the Active Directory (unreachable domain controller).
    Passwords of the accounts of Windows services
    Passwords for scheduled tasks
    More (password of IIS applications...)

NTDS.dit

It is the database of the Active Directory. It is only present in Domain Controllers.
